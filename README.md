<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>

* I practiced the basics of JavaScript ECMAScript 2015+
* I practiced to create a class, constructor, what is "this", parameters in a function
* Arrow functions
* used the webapack

it was a harder task for me because it was important to build the appropriate application logic.

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* and then "go live" is enough
